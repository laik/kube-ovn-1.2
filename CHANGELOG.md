# CHANGELOG

## v1.2.1 -- 2020/06/22
This release fix bugs found in v1.2.0

### Bugfix
* Add back privilege for IPv6
* Update loopback cni to fix CVE issues
* Node annotations overwrite incorrectly
* Create/Delete order might lead to ip conflict

## v1.2.0 -- 2020/05/30
In this version, Kube-OVN support vlan and dpdk type network interfaces for higher performance requirement.
Thanks for Intel and Ruijie Networks guys who contribute these features.

Previously to expose Pod IP to external network, admins have to manually add static routes. 
Now admins can try the new BGP features to dynamically announce routes to external network.

From this version, subnet CIDR can be changed after creation, and routes will be changed if gateway type is modified.

### New Feature
* Kube-OVN now supports OVS-DPDK, high performance dpdk application can run in pod
* Kube-OVN now supports vlan underlay network to achieve better network performance
* Kube—OVN now supports using BGP to announce Pod IP routes to external network
* Subnet validator will check if subnet CIDR conflicts with svc or node CIDR
* Subnet CIDR can be changed after creation
* When subnet gateway changed, routes will aromatically changed
 

### Monitoring
* Check if dns and kubernetes svc exist
* Make grafana dashboard more sensitive to changes 

### Misc
* Patch upstream ovn to reduce lflow count
* Add support for arm64 platform
* Add support for kubernetes 1.18
* Use github action to perform CI tasks
* Optimize some log information
* Move image to dockerhub


### Bugfix:

## v1.1.0 -- 2020/04/07

In this version, we refactor IPAM to separate IP allocation logical from OVN. 
On top of that we provide a general cluster wide IPAM utility for other CNI plugins. 
Now other CNI plugins like macvlan/host-device/vlan etc can take advantage of subnet and static ip allocation functions in Kube-OVN.
Please check [this document](docs/multi-nic.md) to see how we combine Kube-OVN and Multus-CNI to provide multi-nic container network.

### IPAM
* Separate IPAM logical form OVN
* Add support for Multus-CNI

### Performance
* Recycle address if pod in failed or succeeded phase
* Delete chassis form ovn-sb when node deleted
* Only enqueue updatePod when needed
* Add x86 optimization CFLAGS
* Add support to disable encapsulation checksum

* Diagnose will check crd status
* Diagnose will check kube-proxy and coredns status
